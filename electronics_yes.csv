3,"before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car, try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .",1
8,"if this doesnt bring back the picture, try pressing this button without playing a dvd .",1
9,"if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !",1
12,press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .,1
14,"by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .",1
24,i would recommend buying one .,1
41,"if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .",1
46,"for the money , get a better quality player .",1
48,i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .,1
51,"pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !",1
57,this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .,1
84,save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .,1
87,it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .,1
102,"while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .",1
103,"any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .",1
113,"do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .",1
121,"amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !",1
122,there should have been a recall on this product .,1
123,fair warning - do not buy .,1
124,i repeat - do n't waste your money .,1
150,do not buy this player .,1
165,get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .,1
184,now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .,1
185,but for $ 49.99 go get one !,1
209,pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .,1
222,i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .,1
224,"so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .",1
227,bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .,1
235,i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .,1
241,do n't waste your money .,1
247,spend the money its well worth it .,1
250,"for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.",1
310,you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .,1
317,things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !,1
336,do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !,1
390,"because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .",1
401,take my words and give it a try .,1
409,spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .,1
425,i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .,1
427,"be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .",1
480,update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !,1
487,i 'd recommend against this unit .,1
498,my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .,1
508,recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .,1
533,if only it played stand alone avi files .,1
548,3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .,1
556,save yourself some aggrivation .,1
562,to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing .,1
569,"also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .",1
576,save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .,1
672,"only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .",1
678,"if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !",1
693,"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .",1
695,i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .,1
700,"as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .",1
702,"a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .",1
716,"do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .",1
722,"despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .",1
736,"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .",1
742,you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .,1
754,do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .,1
755,"unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .",1
757,anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .,1
760,i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !,1
765,"i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .",1
776,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .",1
790,i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !,1
798,"if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .",1
799,"if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .",1
800,"if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .",1
802,i highly recommend it .,1
816,i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .,1
831,and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .,1
842,overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .,1
843,"for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .",1
844,you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .,1
846,"if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .",1
852,"what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .",1
865,"for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .",1
866,"in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .",1
868,"you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .",1
869,"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .",1
874,"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .",1
880,"maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .",1
887,"what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .",1
891,this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .,1
898,"or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .",1
920,"looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .",1
962,"always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !",1
965,"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .",1
967,make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !,1
979,"when it arrives , you press the shutter release .",1
1000,so buy the g3 .,1
1001,"buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .",1
1002,"but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .",1
1026,"despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .",1
1036,"this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !",1
1053,"as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .",1
1056,"for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .",1
1072,it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .,1
1084,"yes , i recommend it over the competition .",1
1086,"this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .",1
1088,"for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .",1
1091,save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .,1
1102,get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .,1
1105,"unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .",1
1108,"however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .",1
1126,"go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .",1
1130,the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .,1
1137,"if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .",1
1143,"unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .",1
1155,please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .,1
1171,my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .,1
1196,"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .",1
1216,"you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .",1
1226,"if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !",1
1228,"the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .",1
1229,but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .,1
1243,this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .,1
1244,"it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to  get into  it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .",1
1267,"yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .",1
1282,"can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .",1
1283,"get it , it 's woth every penny ! !",1
1290,"you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck",1
1292,"if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .",1
1310,"the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .",1
1314,"it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .",1
1315,"the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .",1
1317,"( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )",1
1321,i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .,1
1333,just get some new headphones and your set .,1
1369,"if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .",1
1394,"if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .",1
1395,"but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .",1
1426,i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .,1
1438,"come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .",1
1500,"buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .",1
1504,"and go from there ... if you chose one of the  all  options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .",1
1508,you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.,1
1535,this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .,1
1538,get better headphones .,1
1539,"rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .",1
1567,the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .,1
1575,if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .,1
1578,just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !,1
1587,"i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .",1
1608,"needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .",1
1614,"if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .",1
1625,"you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .",1
1638,"buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .",1
1641,the interface used could be better designed .,1
1676,"if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .",1
1688,features that would have been nice :,1
1693,a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .,1
1695,do n't drop this unit :,1
1702,if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .,1
1707,i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .,1
1712,"for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .",1
1716,you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .,1
1717,"if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).",1
1728,"it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .",1
1769,"transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .",1
1771,"artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .",1
1777,dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .,1
1795,"so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .",1
1799,"thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !",1
1812,"do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .",1
1820,do n't buy this thing .,1
1827,"overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .",1
1838,"btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .",1
1849,"the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .",1
1852,"i would recommend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .",1
1877,"for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .",1
1878,"if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .",1
1879,read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !,1
1887,"yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .",1
1897,1 ) a spare battery would have been great .,1
1904,"transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .",1
1907,"you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .",1
1920,it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .,1
1926,cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .,1
1929,"as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .",1
1943,"i would recommend replacing the existing software with the  notmad explorer ,  which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .",1
1952,a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .,1
1953,"i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .",1
1960,i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .,1
1961,"up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .",1
1964,"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .",1
1967,you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .,1
1985,"buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .",1
2002,"if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .",1
2004,i would recommend this product to anyone .,1
2011,"the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .",1
2048,well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .,1
2059,"from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).",1
2075,buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .,1
2076,"for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .",1
2077,a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .,1
2082,so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .,1
2083,"also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .",1
2102,but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .,1
2107,"also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).",1
2125,"you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .",1
2133,the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .,1
2138,"you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .",1
2154,"if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !",1
2187,as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !,1
2208,so consider what you 're going to use the device for .,1
2209,"if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .",1
2210,"if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .",1
2221,you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .,1
2236,"if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .",1
2243,but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .,1
2301,"before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .",1
2314,"if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .",1
2315,"or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .",1
2326,point the  media sniffer  to your music files and let it do the rest .,1
2332,"they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .",1
2340,"it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .",1
2363,do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .,1
2364,many reviewers refer to it as  clunky  or  difficult  - heed their warnings .,1
2366,"i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .",1
2375,if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .,1
2389,"notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...",1
2406,my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .,1
2432,i cannot recommend it enough ! !,1
2439,"do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .",1
2505,the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .,1
2506,4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .,1
2507,5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .,1
2511,i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .,1
2517,1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .,1
2518,2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .,1
2519,3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .,1
2554,wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .,1
2580,"connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !",1
2581,"get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .",1
2589,"i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .",1
2595,get one now !,1
2623,"at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .",1
2631,"if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .",1
2632,all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .,1
2633,"if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .",1
2642,"synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .",1
2663,"if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .",1
2679,if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .,1
2681,"if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .",1
2682,"if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .",1
2692,"if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .",1
2693,"if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .",1
2697,here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .,1
2718,"if you are planning to buy that player , do not !",1
2730,"if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .",1
2765,"try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .",1

3467,only if we could get one camera in it . .,1
3522,"they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .",1
3528,here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .,1

3746,the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .,1
3747,this phone is highly recommended otherwise .,1
3750,the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .,1
3756,"bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .",1

3767,go for it ...,1
3771,i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .,1
3773,my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .,1
3774,"if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .",1
