8,"if this doesnt bring back the picture, try pressing this button without playing a dvd .",1,0
9,"if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !",1,0
12,press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .,1,0
14,"by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .",1,1
24,i would recommend buying one .,1,1
41,"if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .",1,1
46,"for the money , get a better quality player .",1,0
48,i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .,1,1
51,"pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !",1,1
57,this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .,1,1
84,save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .,1,1
87,it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .,1,1
102,"while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .",1,1
103,"any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .",1,1
113,"do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .",1,1
121,"amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !",1,0
122,there should have been a recall on this product .,1,1
123,fair warning - do not buy .,1,0
124,i repeat - do n't waste your money .,1,0
150,do not buy this player .,1,1
165,get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .,1,1
184,now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .,1,1
185,but for $ 49.99 go get one !,1,0
209,pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .,1,1
222,i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .,1,1
224,"so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .",1,1
227,bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .,1,1
235,i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .,1,1
241,do n't waste your money .,1,1
247,spend the money its well worth it .,1,1
250,"for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.",1,1
310,you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .,1,0
317,things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !,1,1
336,do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !,1,1
390,"because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .",1,1
401,take my words and give it a try .,1,1
409,spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .,1,1
425,i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .,1,1
427,"be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .",1,1
480,update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !,1,1
487,i 'd recommend against this unit .,1,1
498,my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .,1,1
508,recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .,1,1
533,if only it played stand alone avi files .,1,1
548,3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .,1,1
556,save yourself some aggrivation .,1,0
562,to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing .,1,0
569,"also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .",1,1
576,save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .,1,1
672,"only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .",1,0
678,"if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !",1,0
693,"ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .",1,1
695,i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .,1,1
700,"as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .",1,1
702,"a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .",1,1
716,"do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .",1,1
722,"despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .",1,1
736,"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .",1,1
742,you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .,1,0
754,do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .,1,1
755,"unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .",1,1
757,anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .,1,1
760,i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !,1,1
765,"i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .",1,1
776,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .",1,1
790,i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !,1,1
798,"if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .",1,1
799,"if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .",1,0
800,"if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .",1,1
802,i highly recommend it .,1,1
816,i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .,1,1
831,and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .,1,0
842,overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .,1,1
843,"for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .",1,0
844,you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .,1,0
846,"if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .",1,0
852,"what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .",1,1
865,"for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .",1,1
866,"in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .",1,0
868,"you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .",1,1
869,"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .",1,0
874,"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .",1,0
880,"maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .",1,0
887,"what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .",1,1
891,this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .,1,1
898,"or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .",1,0
920,"looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .",1,1
962,"always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !",1,0
965,"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .",1,0
967,make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !,1,1
979,"when it arrives , you press the shutter release .",1,0
1000,so buy the g3 .,1,0
1001,"buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .",1,1
1002,"but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .",1,0
1026,"despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .",1,1
1036,"this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !",1,1
1053,"as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .",1,1
1056,"for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .",1,0
1072,it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .,1,1
1084,"yes , i recommend it over the competition .",1,1
1086,"this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .",1,0
1088,"for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .",1,1
1091,save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .,1,1
1102,get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .,1,1
1105,"unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .",1,0
1108,"however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .",1,0
1126,"go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .",1,1
1130,the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .,1,0
1137,"if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .",1,1
1143,"unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .",1,0
1155,please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .,1,1
1171,my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .,1,1
1196,"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .",1,1
1216,"you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .",1,1
1226,"if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !",1,0
1228,"the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .",1,0
1229,but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .,1,0
1243,this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .,1,1
1244,"it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to  get into  it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .",1,1
1267,"yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .",1,0
1282,"can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .",1,1
1283,"get it , it 's woth every penny ! !",1,1
1290,"you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck",1,1
1292,"if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .",1,1
1310,"the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .",1,0
1314,"it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .",1,1
1315,"the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .",1,1
1317,"( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )",1,0
1321,i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .,1,1
1333,just get some new headphones and your set .,1,0
1369,"if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .",1,1
1394,"if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .",1,1
1395,"but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .",1,1
1426,i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .,1,1
1438,"come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .",1,1
1500,"buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .",1,0
1504,"and go from there ... if you chose one of the  all  options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .",1,1
1508,you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.,1,1
1535,this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .,1,1
1538,get better headphones .,1,1
1539,"rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .",1,1
1567,the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .,1,1
1575,if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .,1,1
1578,just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !,1,1
1587,"i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .",1,1
1608,"needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .",1,1
1614,"if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .",1,0
1625,"you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .",1,0
1638,"buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .",1,1
1641,the interface used could be better designed .,1,1
1676,"if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .",1,0
1688,features that would have been nice :,1,1
1693,a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .,1,1
1695,do n't drop this unit :,1,1
1702,if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .,1,0
1707,i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .,1,1
1712,"for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .",1,0
1716,you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .,1,1
1717,"if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).",1,1
1728,"it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .",1,1
1769,"transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .",1,1
1771,"artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .",1,1
1777,dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .,1,0
1795,"so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .",1,1
1799,"thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !",1,1
1812,"do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .",1,1
1820,do n't buy this thing .,1,1
1827,"overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .",1,1
1838,"btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .",1,1
1849,"the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .",1,0
1852,"i would recommend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .",1,1
1877,"for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .",1,1
1878,"if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .",1,1
1879,read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !,1,1
1887,"yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .",1,0
1897,1 ) a spare battery would have been great .,1,1
1904,"transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .",1,1
1907,"you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .",1,0
1920,it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .,1,1
1926,cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .,1,1
1929,"as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .",1,1
1943,"i would recommend replacing the existing software with the  notmad explorer ,  which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .",1,1
1952,a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .,1,1
1953,"i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .",1,1
1960,i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .,1,1
1961,"up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .",1,1
1964,"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .",1,1
1967,you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .,1,1
1985,"buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .",1,1
2002,"if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .",1,0
2004,i would recommend this product to anyone .,1,1
2011,"the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .",1,1
2048,well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .,1,1
2059,"from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).",1,0
2075,buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .,1,1
2076,"for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .",1,1
2077,a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .,1,1
2082,so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .,1,0
2083,"also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .",1,1
2102,but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .,1,1
2107,"also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).",1,1
2125,"you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .",1,1
2133,the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .,1,1
2138,"you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .",1,1
2154,"if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !",1,1
2187,as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !,1,1
2208,so consider what you 're going to use the device for .,1,0
2209,"if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .",1,1
2210,"if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .",1,1
2221,you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .,1,0
2236,"if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .",1,1
2243,but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .,1,0
2301,"before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .",1,0
2314,"if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .",1,0
2315,"or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .",1,0
2326,point the  media sniffer  to your music files and let it do the rest .,1,0
2332,"they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .",1,1
2340,"it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .",1,1
2363,do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .,1,1
2364,many reviewers refer to it as  clunky  or  difficult  - heed their warnings .,1,0
2366,"i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .",1,1
2375,if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .,1,0
2389,"notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...",1,1
2406,my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .,1,1
2432,i cannot recommend it enough ! !,1,1
2439,"do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .",1,1
2505,the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .,1,1
2506,4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .,1,1
2507,5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .,1,0
2511,i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .,1,1
2517,1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .,1,0
2518,2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .,1,0
2519,3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .,1,0
2554,wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .,1,1
2580,"connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !",1,1
2581,"get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .",1,1
2589,"i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .",1,1
2595,get one now !,1,1
2623,"at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .",1,1
2631,"if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .",1,1

2730,"if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .",1,1
2765,"try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .",1,1
2770,"my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .",1,0
2818,please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .,1,1

2824,do not buy this product --,1,1

2915,i enthusiastically recommend this camera .,1,1
2942,be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .,1,1
2946,would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .,1,1
2989,try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .,1,1
2990,"whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .",1,1
2991,"and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .",1,0
3006,"i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :",1,1
3030,i definately recommend a large memory card .,1,1
3033,"battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .",1,1
3057,"i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .",1,1
3066,100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .,1,0
3074,"if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .",1,0
3075,go get it .,1,1
3098,"so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .",1,0
3115,"do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .",1,1
3121,"try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .",1,1
3122,"consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .",1,1
3124,use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .,1,1
3129,i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .,1,1
3143,an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .,1,1
3148,"in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .",1,1
3171,i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .,1,1
3181,buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .,1,1
3182,do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .,1,1
3185,read the directions !,1,1
3188,i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .,1,1
3190,"buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .",1,1
3191,"if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !",1,1

3207,"if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .",1,1
3219,a card with more memory is a must .,1,0

3261,"the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .",1,1
3314,i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .,1,1
3338,i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .,1,0
3392,"if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .",1,0
3404,"overall , i highly recommend this phone .",1,1
3410,"surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .",1,1
3467,only if we could get one camera in it . .,1,0
3522,"they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .",1,1
3528,here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .,1,0
3553,"so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )",1,0
3565,i highly recommend this phone to anyone .,1,1
3580,"if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .",1,0
3592,"i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .",1,1
3637,bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .,1,0
3651,"this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .",1,0
3669,for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .,1,0
3675,if you thought about getting this phone buy it .,1,0
3680,using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .,1,1
3713,"if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .",1,1
3746,the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .,1,0
3747,this phone is highly recommended otherwise .,1,1
3750,the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .,1,1
3756,"bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .",1,0
3757,"find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .",1,1
3767,go for it ...,1,1
3771,i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .,1,1
3773,my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .,1,1
3774,"if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .",1,1
3776,"i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .",1,1
3778,"6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .",1,1
3779,i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .,1,1

18,im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !,0,0
19,the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .,0,0
20,"but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !",0,0
21,it practically plays almost everything you give it .,0,0
22,i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .,0,0

32,strengths are well listed by other reviewers .,0,0
33,"what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .",0,0
34,that 's a rare and valuable feature .,0,0
35,"i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !",0,0
36,"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .",0,0
37,"saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .",0,1
38,"at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !",0,0
39,"i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .",0,1
40,"weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .",0,1
42,update : the finish is more  mirror  than silver -- and i like it !,0,1

54,new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .,0,0

89,"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air .",0,0
90,"this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .",0,0
91,the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .,0,1
92,"( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )",0,1
93,"the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .",0,1
94,"the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .",0,0
95,"i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .",0,0
96,"while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .",0,1
97,i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .,0,0
98,"the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .",0,0

111,i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .,0,0
112,"as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .",0,0
114,"if i could give this a negative rating , i would .",0,1

172,the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .,0,0
173,"maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .",0,0

208,same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .,0,0
210,"i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .",0,1
211,the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .,0,0
212,loved the slim design .,0,1
213,this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .,0,0
214,apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .,0,0
215,"it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .",0,0
216,audio is excellent .,0,0
217,well worth the money .,0,0
218,"after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .",0,1
219,i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .,0,1
220,"so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .",0,0
221,"i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .",0,1
223,"the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .",0,0
225,"i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .",0,1
226,"but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .",0,0
228,simple to use and hook up .,0,0
229,"comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .",0,1
230,the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .,0,1
231,i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .,0,0
232,one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .,0,0
233,and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .,0,1
234,friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .,0,1
236,consider it for a future gift too !,0,1
237,this dvd play is basicly junk .,0,0
238,it wo n't play all of my movies .,0,0
239,keeps coming up with no disk errors .,0,1
240,"i tried called apex cust service , no help .",0,0
242,"mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .",0,0
243,this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .,0,0
244,you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .,0,1
245,each of the 4 lasted less than six months .,0,0
246,you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .,0,1
248,this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .,0,0
249,"i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .",0,0
251,"this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .",0,1
252,80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .,0,0
253,"having said that , this is what you do .  add to cart  !",0,1
254,i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .,0,1
255,they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .,0,0
256,i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .,0,0
257,i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .,0,1
258,"well , this apex dvd player turned out great !",0,0
259,"it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !",0,1
260,"i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .",0,0
261,it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .,0,0
262,i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .,0,1
263,what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?,0,0
264,i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !,0,0
265,hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .,0,1
266,and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !,0,0
267,"one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .",0,0
268,"finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !",0,0
269,"i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .",0,0
270,the first one would n't work from the start .,0,0
271,the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !,0,0
272,"amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !",0,0
273,i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .,0,0
274,"i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .",0,1
275,i will never buy another apex digital product !,0,1
276,for the most part this is a good dvd player .,0,0
277,"but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .",0,1
278,usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .,0,0
279,we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .,0,0
280,it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .,0,0
281,there was neither picture nor sound .,0,0
282,"connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .",0,1
283,"the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .",0,1
284,i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .,0,0
285,it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .,0,0
286,obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .,0,0
287,we are overall pleased with product .,0,1
288,i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .,0,1
289,i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .,0,0
290,another stupid move .,0,0
291,i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .,0,0
292,it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . ),0,0
293,"i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .",0,0
294,i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !,0,1
295,neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . ),0,0
296,i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .,0,0
297,"let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :",0,1
298,"you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .",0,0
299,"it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .",0,0
300,i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .,0,0
301,"amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).",0,0
302,"progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .",0,0
303,"seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .",0,1
304,"also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .",0,0
305,"output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .",0,0
306,"i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .",0,1
307,"it would just spin up and stop , and display  no disc  .",0,0
308,"my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .",0,0
309,"for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .",0,0
311,"also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv ).",0,1
312,ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .,0,0
313,"i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .",0,1
314,i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .,0,1
315,lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .,0,1
316,looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .,0,1
318,"and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !",0,0
319,this thing plays everything i feed it .,0,0
320,i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .,0,1
321,when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .,0,1
322,"easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .",0,0
323,i wish i could give negative stars !,0,1
324,i bought this dvd player in november .,0,0
325,i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .,0,0
326,i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .,0,0
327,what a mistake !,0,0
328,after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .,0,0
329,i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .,0,0

332,i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .,0,0
333,i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .,0,0

335,"that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .",0,0
337,i bought this as a gift for my sister .,0,0
338,it has never worked .,0,0
339,"i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .",0,0
340,i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .,0,0
341,purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .,0,1
342,the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .,0,1
343,the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .,0,0
344,i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .,0,1
345,i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .,0,0
346,they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .,0,0
347,i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .,0,1
348,"i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .",0,0

350,still no response .,0,0
351,i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .,0,0

353,3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .,0,0
354,now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .,0,0
355,"have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .",0,1
356,"have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .",0,1

359,i bought this product from amazon .,0,0
360,"after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .",0,0
361,i can only hear the sound but no picture !,0,0
362,their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .,0,0
363,"no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .",0,0
364,i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .,0,0
365,"however , i should have followed my instincts :",0,1
366,you get what you pay for .,0,0
367,one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .,0,0
368,some dvd 's i rented would not play .,0,0
369,"now , i suddenly have no picture .",0,0
370,"when the player was working it was great ,but .",0,0
371,the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .,0,0
372,"the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :",0,0
373,i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .,0,0
374,"i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).",0,0
375,it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .,0,0
376,without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .,0,0
377,"excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .",0,0
378,"remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .",0,1
379,"anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .",0,1
380,"i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :",0,1
381,"with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .",0,0
382,"first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .",0,0
383,"unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon  , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .",0,0
384,"as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .",0,0
385,what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .,0,0
386,"for example , i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .",0,0
387,"at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well .",0,0
388,this player seems to work fine with everything else .,0,0
389,so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .,0,1
391,i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .,0,0
392,had no problem with it .,0,1
393,"now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .",0,0

400,if you are skeptical about trying apex .,0,0
402,hopefully you wo n't regret .,0,1
403,i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !,0,0
404,this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .,0,1
405,"i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !",0,0
406,so much packed in a small case and very affordable !,0,0
407,worked for two weeks .,0,1
408,after two weeks the picture kept freezing .,0,0
410,only the cheap and poor would buy one .,0,0
411,unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .,0,0
412,i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .,0,0
413,"it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .",0,0
414,"basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .",0,0
415,"so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .",0,0
416,"the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .",0,0
417,"again , though , it has only been used sparingly .",0,0
418,"the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .",0,0
419,it 's not a big deal for me .,0,0
420,i simply watched the extra features on another player .,0,0
421,"had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .",0,1
422,"as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .",0,0
423,"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .",0,0
424,"but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .",0,1
426,there are a lot of things i like about it .,0,0
428,received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .,0,1
429,the remote is a little hard to understand .,0,0
430,my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor .,0,0
431,so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .,0,1

433,i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .,0,0

441,there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .,0,0
442,"but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .",0,0
443,amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .,0,0
444,perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands .,0,0
445,"i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .",0,1
446,the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .,0,0

449,"great feature list , poor reliability .",0,0
450,"output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .",0,0

455,i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .,0,0
456,so far we have only hooked up one of them .,0,0
457,"the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and some not so good , but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up  !",0,0
458,( i guess only time will tell ? ),0,0
459,p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?,0,1
460,what the hell is wrong with this thing .,0,0
461,i bought this thing because it plays everything .,0,0
462,this is the third apex dvd i bought .,0,0
463,the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .,0,0
464,the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .,0,0
465,but heck it plays my alias dvds .,0,0
466,what the heck is up with the 2600 .,0,0
467,it suppose to play everything .,0,0
468,by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .,0,0
469,i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .,0,0
470,forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.,0,1

481,"the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .",0,0
482,i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .,0,0
483,"after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated  no disk  .",0,0
484,"after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .",0,0

491,imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .,0,1
492,the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .,0,0
493,do not recommend .,0,1
494,"what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .",0,1
495,in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .,0,0
496,and have returned both .,0,0
497,the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .,0,0
499,"i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .",0,0

563,"if the dvd is stopped , it will display  playback only  .",0,0
564,"little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .",0,0
565,i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .,0,0
566,"of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .",0,0
567,"the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .",0,0
568,it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .,0,0
570,"but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .",0,0
571,i bought this for my dad for christmas .,0,0
572,"when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !",0,0
573,let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .,0,1
574,as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .,0,1
575,had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .,0,1
577,bought one for $ 49.99 .,0,1
578,"seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes ,  no disc  .",0,1
579,sent mine back .,0,1
580,i 'd look elsewhere .,0,0
581,"granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .",0,1
582,"first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .",0,1
583,"when i hit  menu  it told me ,  playback only .",0,0
584,i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .,0,0
585,this is extemely lame .,0,0
586,the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .,0,0
587,"in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .",0,1
588,the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .,0,0
589,"it also has an optical out , which it should .",0,1
590,"i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .",0,1
591,"i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .",0,0
592,"after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .",0,0
593,"it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .",0,0
594,"both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .",0,0
595,one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .,0,0
596,"these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .",0,0
597,the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .,0,0
598,"there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .",0,0
599,"all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .",0,0
600,"i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .",0,0
601,"i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .",0,1
602,i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .,0,0
603,i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .,0,0
604,"there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .",0,1
605,"still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !",0,0
606,so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .,0,0
607,i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !,0,0
608,"ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .",0,0
609,i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !,0,0
610,"i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !",0,0
611,my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .,0,0
612,upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .,0,0
613,i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .,0,0
614,the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .,0,0
615,i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .,0,0
616,guess where this unit is headed ?,0,0
617,"yup , right back for a refund !",0,0
618,i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .,0,0
619,"i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .",0,0
620,"unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .",0,0
621,i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .,0,0
622,"i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .",0,1
623,this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .,0,0
624,"ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all",0,0
625,"the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel",0,1
626,"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .",0,0
627,"if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .",0,0
628,this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .,0,0
629,i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !,0,0
630,apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .,0,0
631,"also , very light and portable .",0,0
632,the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .,0,0
633,it will read and play all cd audio disc .,0,0
634,guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one .,0,1
635,so far not going to get a good review .,0,0
636,i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .,0,0
637,i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .,0,0
638,that is where my satisfaction ends .,0,0
639,i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .,0,0
640,"however , it has failed to deliver on quality .",0,0
641,"it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .",0,0
642,on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside .,0,0
643,after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .,0,0
644,"i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .",0,0
645,"i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .",0,0
646,i guess you get what you pay for .,0,0
647,the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .,0,0
648,"picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .",0,0
649,clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .,0,0
650,i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .,0,0
651,i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .,0,0
652,no go on most formats .,0,0
653,it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .,0,0
654,"however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .",0,0
655,"i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .",0,1
656,"also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .",0,0
657,bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's .,0,1
658,can 't say whether i rec 'd an  updated  model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .,0,0
659,it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .,0,0
660,i do n't have a dvd + r to try,0,0
661,mixed bag i guess but the price was right .,0,0
662,this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .,0,0
663,it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom .,0,0
664,"the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .",0,0
665,"i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .",0,0

668,i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .,0,0
669,i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .,0,1
670,"there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .",0,0
671,"so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !",0,0
673,otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !,0,0
674,"noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .",0,0
675,silverish color really adds a special touch .,0,1
676,who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?,0,0
677,it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . ),0,0
679,apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .,0,0
680,if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .,0,0
681,"however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .",0,0
682,"either way , can 't go wrong with this price .",0,1
683,i am really impressed by this dvd player .,0,0
684,"if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .",0,0

687,"the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .",0,0
688,"after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .",0,0
689,"i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .",0,0
690,they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .,0,0
691,a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .,0,1
692,i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .,0,0
694,"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .",0,0
696,"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !",0,0
697,"i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .",0,1
698,"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .",0,0
699,"whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .",0,0
701,i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .,0,0

707,overall i 'm happy with my toy .,0,0
708,i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .,0,0
709,"a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .",0,0
710,"following my research , i decided on the g3 .",0,1
711,"in a word ,  awesome  is how i would describe this camera .",0,0
712,"i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .",0,1
713,"with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .",0,0
714,"and with the panoramic  stitch  mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .",0,0
715,"i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .",0,0
717,i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .,0,0
718,i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .,0,0
719,"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .",0,0
720,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .",0,0
721,still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .,0,0
723,i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .,0,0
724,the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .,0,0

726,"i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .",0,1
727,"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )",0,1
728,i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .,0,1
729,"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .",0,1
730,excellent range of metering options as well .,0,0
731,it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .,0,0
732,2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ),0,0
733,3 ) 4x zoom is nice,0,0
734,"4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .",0,0
735,5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .,0,0
737,"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )",0,0
738,2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ),0,1

740,the camera has a wonderful set of features .,0,0
741,the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .,0,0
743,the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .,0,1
744,the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .,0,0
745,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .",0,1
746,"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .",0,0
747,the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .,0,0
748,the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .,0,0
749,it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .,0,0
750,recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .,0,0
751,advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .,0,1
752,newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .,0,1

756,those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .,0,1
758,the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .,0,0

761,"it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .",0,0
762,i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .,0,0
763,i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .,0,0
764,"the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .",0,0
766,i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .,0,0
767,what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?,0,0
768,"i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .",0,1
769,"at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .",0,1
770,"i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .",0,0
771,"i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !",0,0
772,"this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .",0,0
773,the prints are beautiful !,0,0
774,and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .,0,0
775,"i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .",0,0
777,this is a great camera for you !,0,0
778,the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .,0,0
779,i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !,0,1
780,"i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .",0,0
781,"i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .",0,0
782,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !",0,0
783,once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .,0,0
784,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .",0,1
785,the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .,0,0
786,it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !,0,0
787,this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .,0,0

805,night mode is clear as day .,0,0
806,"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .",0,0
807,the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .,0,0

812,i just bought the camera a few days ago .,0,0
813,"before i  get used to it  , here are my first feelings :",0,0
814,"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )",0,0
815,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .",0,0
817,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .",0,1
818,i bought this last week through amazon .,0,0
819,got a great deal from a reputable seller .,0,1
820,i love this camera .,0,0
821,i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .,0,0
822,took hundreds of pictures and they were great .,0,1
823,"great colors , pictures and white balance .",0,0
824,has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .,0,1
825,it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .,0,0
826,"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .",0,0
827,it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .,0,0
828,"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .",0,0
829,i do n't think i was asking too much .,0,0
830,any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .,0,1
832,i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .,0,0
833,i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .,0,1
834,that meant even less light and just as much action .,0,0
835,"sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .",0,0
836,the grain was terrible .,0,0
837,next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .,0,0
838,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .",0,0
839,"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .",0,0
840,the camera was a marvel .,0,0
841,getting the printer to help output them was another tale .,0,1
845,then again a one time use camera may do just as well .,0,0
847,it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .,0,0
848,"me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .",0,0
849,"it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .",0,0
850,"i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .",0,0
851,"i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .",0,0
853,"i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .",0,0
854,hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .,0,1
855,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .",0,0
856,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .",0,1
857,"as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .",0,0
858,"at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .",0,0
859,what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .,0,1
860,"once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .",0,1
861,now what about the flash problem ?,0,0
862,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .",0,1
863,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .",0,1
864,"i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .",0,1
867,"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .",0,0
870,"the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .",0,0
871,"this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .",0,1
872,"unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .",0,0
873,the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .,0,0
875,"the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .",0,1
876,the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .,0,0
877,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !",0,0
878,"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .",0,0
879,i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .,0,0
881,i didnt wait to experiment .,0,0
882,"instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .",0,0
883,what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .,0,0
884,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !",0,0
885,the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .,0,0
886,what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .,0,1
888,but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .,0,0
889,"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .",0,1
890,"i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .",0,1
892,my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .,0,0
893,"battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .",0,0
894,"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .",0,0
895,"i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .",0,0
896,"not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .",0,1
897,"if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .",0,0
899,"after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .",0,0
900,"the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .",0,0
901,i 'm very glad i did .,0,0
902,the service from the supplier was excep
